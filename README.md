### About

&nbsp; trailer_cube is a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Ruby on Rails</a>-based application which depends on <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a>. All media is stored on and served from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.

&nbsp; The entirety of the user interface, with the exception of the header and footer, is rendered in 3D and contained within a single `<div>` element.
